# Phase 06 Reference Architecture and Operations Manual

## 1. Document Control

### 1.1 Document Purpose
This document defines Phase 06 in full operational detail.
This document is the authoritative reference for design, execution, governance, and audit of incident management.
This document is written for teams with no assumed prior context.

### 1.2 Intended Audience
Security analysts.
Incident leads.
SOC managers.
Platform engineers.
Product engineers.
Compliance and audit stakeholders.
Program and delivery leadership.

### 1.3 Scope Statement
Phase 06 governs how security incidents are created, triaged, investigated, contained, eradicated, recovered, resolved, and closed.
Phase 06 defines operating controls for ownership, SLA, evidence handling, lifecycle integrity, and auditability.

### 1.4 Non-Scope Statement
Phase 06 does not implement autonomous response orchestration beyond controlled manual or semi-manual actions.
Phase 06 does not replace tenant-wide RBAC foundation work but must be compatible with it.
Phase 06 does not define subscription billing behavior.

### 1.5 Normative Language
"Must" indicates mandatory requirement.
"Must not" indicates prohibited action.
"Should" indicates strong recommendation with documented exception path.
"May" indicates optional behavior when policy allows.

## 2. Phase Definition

### 2.1 What Phase 06 Is
Phase 06 is the lifecycle control layer that converts security signals into governed operational incidents.
Phase 06 standardizes how cases are tracked, owned, prioritized, escalated, and closed.

### 2.2 Why Phase 06 Exists
Alert-centric operations fail under scale due to duplication, inconsistency, and accountability gaps.
Incident-centric operations create a single coordination object with lifecycle policy and measurable outcomes.

### 2.3 Primary Goals
Establish deterministic lifecycle transitions.
Establish role-based accountability with explicit ownership.
Establish SLA clocks and breach visibility.
Establish structured evidence and auditable decision history.
Establish reliable merge and split behavior.

### 2.4 Measurable Value
Reduced mean time to acknowledge.
Reduced mean time to contain.
Reduced reopen rate.
Improved closure quality and audit readiness.
Improved consistency of incident outcomes across teams.

## 3. Terminology and Concepts

### 3.1 Core Terms
Alert: a discrete security signal generated by a detector, control, or external source.
Incident: an operational case containing one or more related alerts requiring coordinated response.
Case owner: the accountable person responsible for progression and quality of one incident.
Incident lead: the coordinating authority for strategy and quality in complex incidents.
Watcher: a stakeholder subscribed to incident updates without primary ownership.
Escalation: transfer of urgency or authority due to risk, complexity, or SLA pressure.
SLA: service-level target duration for response milestones.
SLO: internal objective for service behavior used to tune SLA realism.
Evidence: material that supports findings or decisions.
Chain of custody: record of who handled evidence and when.
Blast radius: scope of potential impact across assets, identities, networks, and business functions.
Root cause: the fundamental causal condition that enabled incident occurrence.
Containment: limiting ongoing malicious activity.
Eradication: removing attacker foothold and causal artifacts.
Recovery: restoring verified normal service state.
Resolution: technical completion with documented remediation.
Closure: governance completion after validation and signoff.
Reopen: reactivation of an incident after resolution due to new evidence or recurrence.
Deduplication: prevention of duplicate objects based on stable keys.
Idempotency: safe repeat of the same request without duplicate side effects.
Transition policy: rule set controlling allowed lifecycle state changes.
Quality gate: mandatory validation checkpoint before progression.
Exception request: explicit temporary override of policy under controlled approval.

### 3.2 Why These Terms Matter
Without strict definitions, teams produce inconsistent actions and unverifiable records.
Consistent terminology is required for cross-team coordination, tooling behavior, and audit defensibility.
