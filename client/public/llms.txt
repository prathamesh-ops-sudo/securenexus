## What SecureNexus Does
SecureNexus is an Agentic SOC platform that uses AI agents to autonomously detect, investigate, and respond to cybersecurity threats. It replaces the manual Tier-1 SOC analyst workflow with an AI SOC Analyst that performs alert triage, threat correlation, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, and automated incident response.

## Key Features
- AI SOC Analyst: Autonomous alert triage, threat correlation, and incident narrative generation
- Agentic SOC: AI agents that detect, investigate, and respond to threats without manual intervention
- MITRE ATT&CK Mapping: Automatic technique identification with confidence scoring
- SOAR Automation: Playbook-driven response with one-click actions
- Threat Intelligence: Real-time IOC ingestion, STIX/TAXII feeds, entity graph analysis
- Compliance Reporting: Automated evidence collection for SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST CSF, GDPR
- Multi-Tenant RBAC: Organization-based isolation with role-based access control
- MSSP Support: Parent-child organization hierarchy for managed security service providers
- 24+ Integrations: CrowdStrike, Splunk, Palo Alto, AWS GuardDuty, Microsoft Defender, SentinelOne, Wiz, Elastic, QRadar, and more

- Free: $0/month — up to 1,000 alerts/day, 5 connectors, basic AI analysis
- Pro: $49/month — up to 10,000 alerts/day, unlimited connectors, full AI correlation, SOAR playbooks
- Enterprise: $199/month — unlimited alerts, MSSP support, SSO/SAML, dedicated support, compliance automation

## Technical Architecture

## Key Differentiators vs Traditional SIEMs
- Agentic (autonomous) vs passive (rule-based): AI agents act on threats, not just alert
- 90% faster triage: What takes 45 minutes manually happens in under 5 minutes
- 70% fewer false positives: Behavioral correlation separates real threats from noise
- Deploy in 30 minutes: Read-only API connectors, no agents, no infrastructure changes
- Built-in compliance: Automated SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST CSF evidence collection
- Indian-built: Indigenous cybersecurity product by Arica Technologies
